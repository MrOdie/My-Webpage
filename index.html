            <h3>About Mr_OhDee</h3>
            <p>Welcome to my official portfolio! Around six months ago I decided to take the first step towards a new career field. In order to cement this decision, my wife and I moved up to the Northern Virginia area.</p>
            <p>For the last six months I have been working tirelessly to learn the in's and out's of all things computer. As a result of my work, I have come to develop a strong skillset in HTML5 and CSS3, while I continue to work at the mastery of JavaScript.</p>

            <h3>My Skills</h3>
            <p>For the last several months I have been soaking up every bit of computer-related knowledge that I could get a hold of.</p>
            <p>I have studied for and successfully passed the <em>CompTIA A+</em> certification exam with only self-study. In order to prepare, I created and maintained a number of Virtual Machines which utilized both Windows and Linux operating systems. Additionally, I worked extensively with the command line in an effort to both better understand the inner workings of the OS and familiarize myself with basic computer mainenance.</p>
            <p>Aside from technical competency, I possess intangible assets that will aide in my ability to execute efficient and working code. While in college, I studied philosophy. This has helped me to establish a strong foundation in problem solving and critical thinking. Additionally, logic is an essential element of philosophy and as such, I also have a strong understanding of logic.  These three skills translate into my ability to not only work with programming languages and coding, but also learn more quickly.</p>
            <p>I possess strong communication skills and even more importantly, people skills. Finally, my sense of humor is dryer than the Sahara.</p>
